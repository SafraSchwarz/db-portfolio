      <p>
        I love learning new things. Similarly, I enjoy seeking new perspectives.
        My ultimate goal is to be a sage, master in an art, and to live until I
        am 121. I believe the journey is more important than the destination. I
        love thinking about the fundamental nature of reality, and
        consciousness. I hope I live long enough to witness the technological
        singularity. Maybe I will have some part in creating the AI that gets us
        there.
